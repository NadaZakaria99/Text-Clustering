 # Text Clustering for Literary Analysis
Text clustering is an essential technique in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), used to group comparable texts or documents based on their content. This unsupervised learning method aims to categorize unstructured text data in a meaningful way, enabling insights and patterns to be extracted from large and diverse datasets.
This project focuses on applying text clustering techniques to a curated selection of classic literary works, including:
•	"Emma" by Jane Austen
•	"Leaves of Grass" by Walt Whitman
•	"Paradise Lost" by John Milton
•	"Moby-Dick; or, The Whale" by Herman Melville
•	"The Man Who Was Thursday" by G.K. Chesterton
Despite these books belonging to different authors and genres, they all hold a significant influence on literary culture. While varying in themes and subject matter, these works collectively emphasize the value of language, the complexities of the human condition, and the enduring nature of art.

### Methodology
To achieve our goals, we utilize a range of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Some of the key steps and libraries employed include:
•	Preprocessing the text data using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
•	Exploratory data analysis and visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
•	Word embedding and analysis with Word2Vec and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) models
•	Clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models
•	Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
•	Evaluation metrics including silhouette score and coherence score
•	Text representation using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word clouds
### Installation
To run this project, you need to have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:
